# HelloVertx
Ceylon project using the Java API

Once you've cloned the project, navigate to the project's root directory and compile it with `ceylon compile`.  This creates a module named `hello`.  From there you can either run the module with `ceylon run hello/1.0.0` or, for added flexibility, create a Fat Jar with `ceylon fat-jar hello/1.0.0` which generates `hello-1.0.0.jar` that you can run with `java -jar hello-1.0.0.jar`
